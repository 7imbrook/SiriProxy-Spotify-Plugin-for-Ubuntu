This is a work in progress plugin for SiriProxy.
It will control Spotify that running on Ubuntu 11.10. I cant get bash commands to run in the plugin,
but can get them to run in test_spotify.rb when using $ruby test_spotify, and not rvmsudo test_spotify.
Im new to ruby and if theres an easier way to do this, please let me know.
